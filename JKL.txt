Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam was born on 15 October
1931 to a Tamil Muslim family in Rameswaram in the Indian state 
of Tamil Nadu. His father's name was Jainulabudeen, a boat owner, 
and his mother Ashiamma, a housewife. His father owned a ferry 
that took Hindu pilgrims back and forth between Rameswaram and 
the nowextinct Dhanushkodi. He came from a poor background and 
started working at an early age to supplement his family's 
income. After completing school, Kalam distributed newspapers to 
contribute to his father's income. In his school years he had 
average grades but was described as a bright and hardworking 
student who had a strong desire to learn and spend hours on his 
studies, especially mathematics. After completing his education
at the Ramanathapuram Schwartz Matriculation School, Kalam went 
on to attend Saint Joseph's College, Tiruchirappalli, then 
affiliated with the University of Madras, from where he graduated 
in physics in 1954. Towards the end of the course, he was not 
enthusiastic about the subject and would later regret the four
years he studied it. He moved to Madras in 1955 to study 
aerospace engineering in Madras Institute of Technology.

Raja Ramanna was born in beginning of 1925 to Rukmini and
Ramanna in Tumkur, in the princely State of Mysore. The 
parents having recognized his talent for music early in in 
life were instrumental in introducing him to classical Western 
music. Beginning his studies at Bishop Cotton Boys' School, 
Bangalore, where he mostly studied literature and classical 
musics. He later attended from Madras Christian College and 
resided at St.Thomas's Hall where he continued his interests
in arts and literature but soon shifted back to physics. At 
Madras Christian College, Ramanna obtained B.Sc. in Physics 
and gained B.A. degree in Classical music in 1947. The same 
year, went on to attended the Bombay University where gained 
his M.Sc. in Physics, followed by M.Mus. in Music theory.
Ramanna was awarded and received Commonwealth Scholarship, and
traveled to Great Britain in 1952 to complete his doctorate. 
Ramanna attended London University's King's College, a 
constitute college of London University, and enrolled in 
doctoral programme there. In 1954, Raja Ramanna obtained Ph.D. 
in Nuclear Physics and also did a L.R.S.M.from King's College 
London. In United Kingdom, Ramanna was offered to do his 
research at Atomic Energy Research Establishment (AERE) where

Classical music is art music produced or rooted in the 
traditions of Western music (both liturgical and secular). It 
encompasses a broad span of time from roughly the 11th century 
to the present day. The central norms of this tradition became 
codified between 1550 and 1900, which is known as the common 
practice period. The major time divisions of classical music 
are as follows: the early music period, which includes the 
Medieval (500–1400) and the Renaissance (1400–1600)
eras; the Common practice period, which includes the Baroque 
(1600–1750), Classical (1750–1830), and Romantic eras (1804–
1910); and the 20th century (1901–2000) which includes the 
modern (1890–1930) that overlaps from the late 19th-century, 
the high modern (mid 20thcentury), and contemporary or 
postmodern (1975–present) eras. European music is largely 
distinguished from many other non-European and popular musical 
forms by its system of staff notation, in use since about the 
16th century. Western staff notation is used by composers to
prescribe to the performer the pitch, speed, meter, individual 
rhythms and exact execution of a piece of music. This leaves 
less room for practices such as improvisation and ad libitum 
ornamentation, which are frequently heard in non-European art 
music and in popular music. Another difference is that whereas 
most popular styles lend themselves to the song form, 
classical music has been noted for its development of highly 
sophisticated forms of instrumental music.

Gautama Buddha, also known as Siddhartha Gautama, Shakyamuni, 
or simply the Buddha, was as age on whose teachings Buddhism 
was founded. He is believed to have lived and taught mostly in 
eastern India sometime between the sixth and fourth
centuries BCE. The word Buddha means "awakened one" or "the 
enlightened one". "Buddha" is also used as a title for the 
first awakened being in a Yuga era. In most Buddhist 
traditions, Siddhartha Gautama is regarded as the Supreme 
Buddha (Pali sammāsam buddha, Sanskrit samyaksaṃ buddha) of our 
age. Gautama taught a Middle Way between sensual indulgence and 
the severe asceticism found in the sramaṇa movement common in 
his region. He later taught throughout regions of eastern
India such as Magadha and Kosala. Gautama is the primary figure 
in Buddhism and accounts of his life, discourses, and monastic 
rules are believed by Buddhists to have been summarized after 
his death and memorized by his followers.The times of Gautama's 
birth and death are uncertain. Most historians in the early 
20th century dated his lifetime as circa 563 BCE to 483
BCE. More recently his death is dated later, between 411 and 
400 BCE, while at a symposium on this question held in 1988, 
the majority of those who presented definite opinions gave 
dates within 20 years either side of 400 BCE for the Buddha's 
death.
